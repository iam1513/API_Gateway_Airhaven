FRONTEND - MIDDLE_END - BACKEND
  
   - We need an intermediate layer 
   - Using this middle end, when client send request we will be able to make make decision that which microservice should respond
   - We can do message validation, rate limiting, response transformation, etc ..,
   - We try to prepare API Gateway to act as middle end
